# Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) Project Report
#### by Huy Dinh, Alexander Powers, Jeya Emmanuel and Denise Okur


At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:


Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions?select=prescriber-info.csv 

CSV and PgAdmin4, Pandas


Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

Operations column didn't have sufficient information so we removed entire columns
Address column wasn't in the right format and some rows had random data, so we didn't use this for our final data



Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
